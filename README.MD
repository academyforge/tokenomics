Standart: TIP31

### Some final ideas

- nft certificates for Tokens
- voting with tokens
- sell some services:
  - teaching
  - mentoring
  -


### Possible idea about tokens:
-  name EVA - Everscale Academy
- Not tokenomics, but way of using:
  - rewards for students
  - course creators prizes
  - nft certificates Transactions payments (but not sure about posibility)
  - buy courses
  - some farming pairs, not only ever
  - partnership pairs on farming
  - utility and voting function (courses and teachers voting, new learning initiatives voting)
  - team rewards

- But we need to discuss realization of such functions.

- Need to define shares of budget to activities in p 2.


And one of the actual issue is Academy marketing and involvement


### Examples to discuss

#### KWT Example

https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/ton-labs.appspot.com/o/documents%2Fapplication%2Fpdf%2F8i6h47gk0ykvfnokwl-KWP%20contest%20submission.pdf?alt=media&token=9835490e-3102-4b68-9af7-42955d4dd144

The Initial Supply of KWT will be determined via the Live WhaleDrop Episode on the 30th of
October, 2021. During the 60 minutes of the WhaleDrop Episode, all the KWT will be minted
and the total farming supply will be calculated.

During the show: KWT is minted according to demand at the event.

The minimum participation threshold is 1,000 TONs
The total maximum initial supply of Killer Tokens is 1,692,461,332
The total maximum pool size in TONs is 1,078,297,217



Full WhaleDrop table is available at the following link:

KWPC Team allocation

Killer Whale Pod Cast will receive 1% off the current Killer token supply but will never exceed
24% of the total token supply


KWP Revenues and Business Model

KWP revenues consist of the Flex Liquidity Pools arbitrage fees from all tokens KWP supports,
listing fees, KWP charges from projects it supports, and ‘Flex Rebound’ transaction fees for
trades on all pairs of its pools.

All KWP revenues are transferred into a special “Reserve'' smart contract. To request funds, the
Killer Whale Token should be sent to the Reserve smart contract where it will be burned in
exchange for its proportion of all accumulated revenues. This enables the floor price of KWT to
sustainably increase over time.




#### SOON Token
Token issuance will be allocated as follows
10% of SOON token issuance will be allocated to Crowdsale (with a lead time of 2 to 6 months, according to Crowdsale terms)
10% of SOON issuance will be allocated to marketing
10% of SOON issuance will be allocated to rewarding SOON Alliance members (on a 1 year listing)
40% of SOON issuance to be allocated to liquidity pools
30% of SOON issuance will be blocked in farming

Deflation
The first thing that SOON Alliance will do after creating the SOON/USDT pool is to send its LP tokens to an uncontrolled smart contract "Black Hole". (Transaction link)
To avoid inflation of the SOON token, deflation mechanisms will be launched, in the form of an additional DAO token (the ticker will be announced later), which can only be obtained by farming the SOON token paired with the LP token of the SOON/USDT pair.
This will allow you to block even more SOON tokens in DEX, reducing the circulating supply, thereby reducing the inflation of the SOON token.

The DAO token will allow users to influence the development of the SOON token by voting on the project's website for proposed events, whether they are new pairs on DEX, new listings or the conclusion of new patents and the management of funds allocated for marketing.
